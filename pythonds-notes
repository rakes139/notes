q1.Naive Approach: The basic approach to solve this problem is by nested traversal.

Traverse the array using a loop
For each element:
Check if there exists another in the array with sum as x
Return true if yes, else continue
If no such pair is found, return false
explanations

In the naive approach, we can use nested traversal to compare each element with every other element in the array. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Traverse the array using a loop: This means we'll go through each element in the array one by one.

For each element, check if there exists another element in the array with a sum equal to the given target value (x): We compare the current element with every other element in the array to see if their sum is equal to the target value.

Return true if a pair is found: If we find a pair of elements whose sum is equal to the target value, we can return true, indicating that such a pair exists.

Continue if no pair is found: If we go through all possible pairs and none of them have a sum equal to the target value, we continue to the next element in the outer loop.

Return false if no pair is found: If we finish traversing the entire array without finding a pair with the desired sum, we can return false, indicating that no such pair exists.

To summarize, the naive approach compares each element with every other element to check for a pair with the given sum. If a pair is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. However, the naive approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested traversal, where n is the size of the array.




Consider the array [2, 9, 5, 7, 12] and the target sum of 14.

Initialize an empty hash set.

Start iterating through the array:

For the first element 2:

Calculate the required sum by subtracting the current element from the target sum: required_sum = 14 - 2 = 12.

The hash set is empty, so add 2 to the set.

For the second element 9:

Calculate the required sum: required_sum = 14 - 9 = 5.

Check if 5 is present in the hash set (not found).

Add 9 to the set.

For the third element 5:

Calculate the required sum: required_sum = 14 - 5 = 9.

Check if 9 is present in the hash set (found). Return true.

Since there exists a pair (9 and 5) whose sum is equal to 14, the algorithm would return true in this case.

In summary, the algorithm checks for each element if there exists another element in the array that, when added, gives the target sum. It uses a hash set to efficiently search for the required sum in constant time. If such a pair is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
