q1.Naive Approach: The basic approach to solve this problem is by nested traversal.

Traverse the array using a loop
For each element:
Check if there exists another in the array with sum as x
Return true if yes, else continue
If no such pair is found, return false
explanations

In the naive approach, we can use nested traversal to compare each element with every other element in the array. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Traverse the array using a loop: This means we'll go through each element in the array one by one.

For each element, check if there exists another element in the array with a sum equal to the given target value (x): We compare the current element with every other element in the array to see if their sum is equal to the target value.

Return true if a pair is found: If we find a pair of elements whose sum is equal to the target value, we can return true, indicating that such a pair exists.

Continue if no pair is found: If we go through all possible pairs and none of them have a sum equal to the target value, we continue to the next element in the outer loop.

Return false if no pair is found: If we finish traversing the entire array without finding a pair with the desired sum, we can return false, indicating that no such pair exists.

To summarize, the naive approach compares each element with every other element to check for a pair with the given sum. If a pair is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. However, the naive approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested traversal, where n is the size of the array.
